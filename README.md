## Usage

Java-Kotlin
Java-Kotlin is a sample application created to explore the interoperability between Java and Kotlin within the Android ecosystem.

The project demonstrates how both languages can coexist in the same environment, sharing classes, methods, and resources without losing compatibility or performance.

Features
Combined source code in Java and Kotlin
Practical examples of interoperability between both languages
Integration with modern Android libraries
Modular and easily extensible architecture
Ideal for developers migrating projects from Java to Kotlin

Purpose
The main goal of Java-Kotlin is to serve as an educational reference for understanding how Kotlin can be gradually integrated into existing Android projects written in Java.
Through clear examples, it shows how both languages can communicate seamlessly, taking advantage of each one’s strengths.

How It Improves Music Apps
While Java-Kotlin itself doesn’t directly enhance music files, it can significantly improve how an app handles and plays them:

Optimized performance: Kotlin’s concise and safe syntax reduces bugs that could affect playback or audio streaming.

Better code maintenance: Interoperability allows developers to add new features (like equalizers, smart playlists, or streaming) without rewriting the entire codebase.

Modern library support: Kotlin integrates smoothly with Android’s latest APIs, such as ExoPlayer, improving stability and audio buffer management.

Lower resource usage: Kotlin’s compiler optimizations make reading, decoding, and playback operations more efficient.

In short, Java-Kotlin doesn’t modify the music files themselves but enhances the development experience and efficiency of apps that manage or play them.

Usage
Clone or download the project.
Open it in Android Studio with Kotlin support enabled.
